            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h4>Like most of all Indian Recipes, the Mumbai Pav Bhaji recipe has an interesting and fascinating history to it. It is believed that the recipe was invented during the 1850s by mill workers. Basically, they would bring all the leftover vegetables and cook them freshly during the lunch break with a blend of spices. In addition, it was served with local bread called pav, because of the short lunch breaks. Also, it was easy to source this bread and more importantly with the combination of curry it was filling and tasty.</h4>
